Hello world! This is a sample text file for testing the Huffman coding program.

It contains various characters including:
- Uppercase letters: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- Lowercase letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
- Numbers: 1234567890
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':\",./<>?
- Spaces and punctuation.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Programming is fun and challenging!

This text should provide enough variety for demonstrating the Huffman coding algorithm's effectiveness in compressing text based on character frequency.
